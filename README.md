# Data-Analysis-Dashboard Using Excel
I developed a comprehensive project in Excel, which involved creating multiple dashboards and tables for data analysis. The project encompassed several stages, such as data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.
Here, I used only Microsoft Excel for this analysis.
This project is divided into different sections that focus on various aspects of data analytics.
